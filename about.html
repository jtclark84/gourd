			<h2>Gourd Light Artistry || About</h2>
			<hr>
			<p class="intro">Jane Mawson is a third generation artist living in Chestnut Hill, Pa., and is a graduate of Washington
			College in Chestertown Maryland. Jane takes inspiration from the Bauhaus tradition of unifying art and craft, design and
			function, in her work creating gourd lamps.
			Jane has shown her work in several galleries in the Philadelphia area, including the Abington Art Center
			and Accent Gallery in Ocean City, New Jersey. Jane will be one of the artists featured in the book ‘Creating
			Gourd Lights’ by artist Susan Nonn, to be published in early 2017.</p>

			<h2>What is a Gourd?</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>A gourd is the hollow, dried shell of a vine fruit in the Cucurbitaceae plant family, similar to a
			cucumber or pumpkin. There are 2 main “types” of gourds, ornamental and hard shelled.  Soft
			shelled, ornamental gourds are the type you see in the fall season and are generally used for
			temporary decorations.  Hard shell gourds, once dried can last forever and are essentially a soft
			wood. There are dozens of varieties of hard shell gourds and their varying sizes and shapes
			have provided a multitude of functional, decorative and spiritual uses, such as containers and
			utensils, masks, musical instruments, jewelry, dolls and more. Gourds have been discovered in
			archaeological sites dating from as early as 13,000 BC, and were domesticated in South
			America, Asia, and Africa. If you travel to Turkey, you will find many gourd light artists whom I
			hope to meet if I get a chance to travel to this region. Their work is unique and has inspired me.
			If you’re interested in what I do you should view the work of <a href="http://www.calabarte.com/" target=new>Calabarte</a>, 
			perhaps the most well known and well regarded artist creating gourd lamps today from his home in Poland. His
			creations are incomparable and started me on this particular path.</p>

			<h2>Process of Creation</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>I consider myself more artisan than artist in that the work I do introduces old world manual skills, such
			as wood working and pyrography (the process of burning designs onto a surface) to create
			contemporary objects that blur the line between craft and art.</p>
			<img class="pull-right img-responsive" src="images/gourdinprogress.jpg">
			<p>Isabelle Guesin, a professor of textile design at a well-regarded art academy in Paris says, “working with
			your hands is a slow, painstaking process that requires patience unseen in today’s society”. And I would
			go further to add that the practice of patience required in my work is a meditative act, quieting the daily 
			grind of multitasking and demands each day brings. This has become especially true in a world where technology
			promises enrichment but fails to support our ability to concentrate and find meaning beyond our
			computer screens.</p>
			<p>I think of my lamps as sculptures that become transformed through illumination at night, which in turn
			transform the spaces they are in, adding beauty and a ‘softening’ experience to the gazer. The inner
			membrane of the gourd is exposed through carving which acts as a screen for the light from inside.
			Depending on the depth of the carved surface, reds, oranges, and yellows are produced and the addition
			of hundreds of holes on the surface allows the light to pass out of the gourd directly and form patterns
			on walls and other surfaces which are close to the lamp when it is lit.</p>

			<h2>Pricing</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>My prices are based upon the complexity, scale, and time devoted to creating each lamp. 
			From the initial cleaning  of the  dried gourd to the finished piece.</p>
			<p>At least fifty hours, if not more, are spent in the multi-layered process. In this context, the value of the lamps far exceeds 
			the price paid. Please be assured that I also take into consideration what the market bears for similar work.</p>
			<p>A percentage of the proceeds will be dononated to the ASPCA.</p>
